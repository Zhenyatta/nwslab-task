Hey!

If you're reading this then you are going to review my code :) First of all I would like to thank YOU for your time.

I would like to tell you that I used React, Redux and TypeScript in this project. I would like to also mention that I used redux toolkit (even tho the task said not to) as in my opinion it suits this project better :D (but again that's just my opinion)

That's it :) have a good day!
